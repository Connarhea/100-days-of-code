# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read the freeCodeCamp.com article about the challenge and decided to give it a go.

**Thoughts:** As it was late in the evening I tweeted about my intent to start the course and will officially begin tomorrow.

### Day 1: January 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Dove back into the HackerRank 30 days of code challenges that I started a long time ago but left very early on.

**Thoughts:** I found I was only up to the 4th day of the challenge but went through the tutorials and completed the problem with ease.
I remember really struggling with it when I first started.

### Day 2: January 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Managed two days of the 30 day HackerRank challenge, spent a lot of time reading through docs.

**Thoughts:** I understand that you shouldn't really be using tutorial time as your hour of code, but due to how early on I am in learning certain aspects of coding I will be using it for the first couple weeks (hopefully less) but will move onto example projects/builds as soon as I'm confident enough.

### Day 3: January 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read up on arrays and managed to smash a problem that had been causing me grief for weeks on another challenge in a matter of minutes on HackerRank Day 7.

**Thoughts:** I've been sick since before Christmas and it's all really catching up on me at the minute, so I did the bare minimum here and read through some MSDN docs, searched for explanations on my problem and then completed the HackerRank challenge. It did take me more than an hour of research and some fiddling about in Visual Studio to retain the knowledge I was getting, but the physical act of completing the task took at most 5 minutes. Hopefully after work tomorrow a trip to the doctors will help me out and I'll be able to put 100% in. 
#### I will not be missing a day, even if I have to scrape through like today
###### Unless I'm truly bed ridden or lose the use of my arms temporarily...

### Day 4: January 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:Read up on, dictionaries, maps and key value pairs and got to work on Day 8 of the HackerRank 30 days of code challenges.

**Thoughts:** Spent today wanting to cry at work, then going to the doctors, but I have antibiotics and the weekend ahead of me to start getting better and to make up the extra time that I would have liked to spent coding during the last few days. key value pairs and dictionaries are the first topic in quite a while that has really challenged me. As hard as t is, I have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge and can't wait to get further into it.
