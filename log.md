### Day 0: January 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read the freeCodeCamp.com article about the challenge and decided to give it a go.

**Thoughts:** As it was late in the evening I tweeted about my intent to start the course and will officially begin tomorrow.

### Day 1: January 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Dove back into the HackerRank 30 days of code challenges that I started a long time ago but left very early on.

**Thoughts:** I found I was only up to the 4th day of the challenge but went through the tutorials and completed the problem with ease.
I remember really struggling with it when I first started.
